MathGame
This game started off as an idea.

But as I worked on it, I found I was inadvertently learning more and more about web development and JavaScript.  Having a project to work on while learning helped me make more connections.

So, I'm making sure to document everything in the hopes that others may stumble across this, find some help, a bit of direction for their own projects, alittle how to / how not to and maybe someday help others with programming.

I maybe be shooting for the moon on that last one.

But better to shoot for the moon, miss and end up among the stars; then to not try and always wonder.
